Welcome to the official source-available repository for the Beartech Workshop SlideMount C4!

The Comma 4 is an incredible device, but its new mounting interface is significantly smaller and narrower than previous generations. This makes achieving a secure, vibration-free connection to the windshield much more challenging. We designed the SlideMount C4 from the ground up to provide the ultimate mounting experience, and we are excited to source-available the design for the maker community.

## 🚀 Why the SlideMount C4?

We engineered this mount to solve the most common issues users face:

* **100% Magnet-Free (Press-to-Unlock):** We ditched the magnets for a rock-solid mechanical lock. This means zero magnetic interference and no rattling.
* **Zero Fan Interference:** The design is specifically contoured to ensure the Comma 4's cooling fan receives unobstructed airflow.
* **Bi-Directional Sliding:** You can slide the device on and off from two different directions, making it much easier to handle in vehicles with tight windshield angles.
* **CNC Aluminum Bracket:** Because the new C4 mounting slot is so much smaller, plastic parts just don't offer enough rigidity. We upgraded the core sliding bracket to **CNC-machined aluminum** to guarantee a rock-solid, vibration-free connection.

## 🛒 Pre-Built vs. DIY

* **Don't want to build it?** We sell the **[Fully Assembled SlideMount C4](https://www.google.com/search?q=link-to-store)**, professionally printed in highly durable ASA-CF, ready to mount out of the box.
* **Want to build or modify it yourself?** You are in the right place! We've open-sourced these files so you can modify the CAD for steep windshield slopes or unique vehicle setups.

To help you bring your custom designs to life without the hassle of hunting down tiny screws and brass inserts, we've put together a companion **[DIY Hardware Starter Kit](https://www.google.com/search?q=link-to-store)**. It provides all the essential core hardware you need to complete the build.

## 🖨️ 3D Printing Material Recommendations

Since the SlideMount will sit on your windshield directly under the hot sun, material choice is critical.

* **Our Top Recommendation:** We strongly recommend printing your casing in **ASA-CF** (Carbon Fiber reinforced ASA). We use this exact material for our pre-built SlideMounts because it offers the absolute best durability, UV resistance, and heat deflection.[(Need filament? You can grab the exact ASA-CF material we use directly from our store).](https://shop.beartech.ca/products/asa-carbon-fiber-filament-black-1-75mm-1kg)
* **Alternative Materials:** You can also successfully print your own parts using standard **ASA, ABS, PA (Nylon), PC (Polycarbonate), or PETG**. Any of these materials blended with Carbon Fiber (-CF) or Glass Fiber (-GF) will also work excellently for added rigidity.
* **Note:** We do **not** recommend standard PLA, as it will warp in the heat of a parked car.

## 📦 What's in the DIY Starter Kit?

If you purchase the DIY Hardware Starter Kit from our store, here is exactly what is included:

* **Essential Hardware Pack:** The core components for your build, including the PCBs, a black mounting plate, a mini screwdriver, tension springs, **brass heat-set inserts**, standoffs, and all the necessary structural screws.
* **Spare Parts Pack:** A backup supply of extra screws, **brass heat-set inserts**, and a spring, giving you peace of mind in case a tiny piece goes missing.
* **Tightening Kit:** An Allen wrench (hex key) accompanied by four screws pre-treated with threadlocker for a secure, vibration-resistant fit.
* **Installation Setup (VHB & Promoters):** 4x packs featuring custom-cut 3M VHB tape, static cling film, wet/dry screen cleaning wipes, and alcohol pads, plus 4x packets of 94 Primer to ensure maximum bond strength.
* **Cable Management:** Four hook-and-loop cable ties to keep your final setup clean.
